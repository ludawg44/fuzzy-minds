About The Group
-----
Welcome to the Github repository for Fuzzy Minds, a group devoted to the understanding of Deep Learning. Our mission is to give our fellow cohorts an opportunity to learn from our experience and refine the content that speaks to the program. 

Consider this a live repo, one that will be constantly updated for future learners. 

Getting Started
-----
To accomodate the transition of new cohorts into the program, we've established weekly and monthly meetings to share our knowledge and lessons learned. We also selected a book, as well as a course to follow from month to month. 

Meetings
-----
Proposed: 
* One weekly non-mandatory 30 meeting on Zoom
* One monthly mandatory 2 on Zoom

Book
-----
