About The Group
-----
Welcome to the Github repository for Fuzzy Minds, a group devoted to the pursuit and understanding of Deep Learning. Our mission is to give our fellow and future cohorts an opportunity to learn from our experiences and further refine in perpetuity. 

Consider this a live repo, one that will be constantly updated for future learners. 

Getting Started
-----
To accomodate the transition of new cohorts into the program, we're establishing weekly and monthly meetings to share our knowledge and lessons learned from the book, online materials, and each other. Links to the book and the course are online. 

Also check out our [one-stop shop](https://github.com/ludawg44/fuzzy-minds/blob/master/One-stop%20Shop.md) containing more information on AI/ML/Deep Learning. 

Meetings
-----
Proposed: 
* One weekly non-mandatory 30 meeting on Zoom
* One monthly mandatory 2 on Zoom

*Google calendar invite pending*

[Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646/ref=pd_sbs_14_1/144-7972152-8579053?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1492032646&pd_rd_r=d4be4346-d342-4c7a-b795-ee61c9cee4e0&pd_rd_w=g7pgm&pd_rd_wg=vnLSI&pf_rd_p=52b7592c-2dc9-4ac6-84d4-4bda6360045e&pf_rd_r=K67744CZYPRQRZMAB9N4&psc=1&refRID=K67744CZYPRQRZMAB9N4)

Through a series of recent breakthroughs, deep learning has boosted the entire field of machine learning. Now, even programmers who know close to nothing about this technology can use simple, efficient tools to implement programs capable of learning from data. This practical book shows you how.

By using concrete examples, minimal theory, and two production-ready Python frameworks—Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow—author Aurélien Géron helps you gain an intuitive understanding of the concepts and tools for building intelligent systems. You’ll learn a range of techniques, starting with simple linear regression and progressing to deep neural networks. With exercises in each chapter to help you apply what you’ve learned, all you need is programming experience to get started.

- Explore the machine learning landscape, particularly neural nets
- Use Scikit-Learn to track an example machine-learning project end-to-end
- Explore several training models, including support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, and ensemble methods
- Use the TensorFlow library to build and train neural nets
- Dive into neural net architectures, including convolutional nets, recurrent nets, and deep reinforcement learning
- Learn techniques for training and scaling deep neural nets

[CS230 Deep Learning](https://cs230.stanford.edu/)

Deep Learning is one of the most highly sought after skills in AI. In this course, you will learn the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects. You will learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more.
