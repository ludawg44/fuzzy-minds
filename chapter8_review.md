## The Curse of Dimensionality
- Point, segment, square, cube, and tesseract (0D to 4D hypercubes)
- The more dimensions the training set has, the greater the risk of overfitting it.

## Main Approaches for Dimensinoality Reduction
- 2 main approaches to reducgin dimensionality: projection & manifold learning

### Projection
- 

### Manifold Learning
- manifold
- manifold hypothesis

## PCA
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is by far the most popular dimensionality reduction algorithm. 
- [Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)

### Preserving the Varience
- "Before you can project the training set onto a lower-dimensional hyperplane, you first need to choose the right hyperplane. 

## Principal Components
- [Single Value Decomposition (SVD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition)
- Principal components matrix equation
- You're going to use NumPy's svd() function

# Projecting Down to d Dimension
1) Identify all the principal components
2) Reduce the dimensionality of the dataset down to d dimensions by projecting it onto the hyperplane defined by the first d principal components.
