# Hands On Machine Learning Chapter Overview
A quick review of the subject and topics covered in each capter with links to help solidify the material. 

## Part 1 - Machine Learning Basics

### Chapter 1

### Chapter 2

### Chapter 3
**SUMMARY**: This chapter focuses classification systems and how to evaluate them. One common way to evaluate a classification system is to use a confusion matrix. He uses the MNIST dataset, the most common and overused, dataset to explain how to do this. 

**STATISTICS**: 
Classification Systems: (definition)

You want to think about classification systems in two ways: binary classification & multiclass classification

Linear classifier algorithms: refer to wikipedia

For unsupervised, supervised & semi-supervised learning algorithms: refer to wikipedia

How does this relate to deep learning? 
- Deep learning uses binary and muliclass classificaitons in their input and hidden layers

**PYTHON**: 

**MATHS**:

Blogs
- I found this blog by [Jack Mcknew](https://jmckew.com/2019/10/18/hands-on-machine-learning-chapter-3/) on chapter 3. It's a quick read. 

Data
- The MNIST dataset has been the introductory dataset for a classification for some time now. As the models have gotten more
sophisticaed, the optimization levels have been identical in both Deep Learning and using more simple Machine Learning models.
Thus the creation of [Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).
